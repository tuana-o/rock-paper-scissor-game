# rock-paper-scissor-game

Another project from The Odin Project but this time adding java script to the mix. The task was to create a "rock paper scissors" where the user competes against the computer for 5 rounds. The user inputs their choice through the prompts appearing in the browser, and each round is determined in the console log, with the score kept track of until the game ends.
